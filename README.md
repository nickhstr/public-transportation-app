# Public Transportation App

An offline-first transportation app for BART. [Check it out!](https://nickhstr-transport-app.firebaseapp.com/)

## Offline-First

You guessed it, this app works offline! Upon first loading the app, its assets are cached (save for the map) by a service worker. From there, each route request is fetched from BART's API, and saved to indexedDB with a key determined by the route's start and end addresses, and the time requested.

When online, all route information is realtime and the most up-to-date. While offline, the only route information available is that requested by the user earlier when online. Rather than saving every single route's schedule to indexedDB, this app - in an effort to save space - simply caches only routes the user has requested.

## Using the App

The app is simple by design, navigable across all devices. On mobile, the map is hidden for more straightforward use; however, larger screens will enjoy the full experience. Additionally, Android users can save the app to the homescreen and use it similarly to a native app. 

A map is included to give a geographical representation of the requested route. The map updates directions when a new route is requested.

After a route is searched for, four upcoming-route results (the max amount of results supplied by BART) are displayed below the inputs, and if there are any special schedule notices, they are displayed below the route results.

## Build Process

Because this app is built with Polymer, its build process is handled by the Polymer CLI. In order to build this app locally:

- Clone the repo and cd into the "transport-app" directory
- Install Polymer CLI `npm install -g polymer-cli`
- Assuming bower is installed, run `bower install`
- Run `polymer-build`

Within the build folder, you'll find two folders, "bundled" and "unbundled". The first consolidates all app assets into one file (in this case "transport-app.html") to reduce the number of requests made to the server; the latter is better suited for HTTP2 servers. For this app, either will work just fine; the performance difference is not significant.

### Important Notes

Please use Google Chrome for this app. It is the only browser guaranteed to fully work with this app.
